# Flipkart-Grid-Resnet-BBox

### Approach Used:  
Generally, detection systems classify or localize the object to perform detection. In our system, we have used tried to detect or localize the object without any classification.
We have used a regressor similar to ResNet34â€™s architecture for localization.


### Source File:  
All of the files are uploaded in a shared folder in google drive with the link as follows:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13BOdvE8srZLuOVVE3A8ncWvo91AUAlm6?usp=sharing

Procedure:  
    1. Install fastai  
    2. Extract the zip file  
    3. Move into the extracted folder  
    4. Using python3 run round3.py with image dataset path as an argument without the last slash (i.e. folder1/folder2,not folder1/folder2/)  
    5. Round3_final_prediction.csv will be created
